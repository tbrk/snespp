SNESPP
======

snespp is a FreeBSD kernel module for Super NES/Famicon controllers 
interfaced via a parallel port. It appears as a keyboard: buttons on the 
controllers send key strokes to the operating system. snespp works under 
both the system console and X windows, using the microseq interface to 
reduce overhead.

The module and source are available under a revised BSD license from here. 
It used to be a part of the FreeBSD ports collection (emulators/snespp), but 
I no longer have the time to maintain it.
